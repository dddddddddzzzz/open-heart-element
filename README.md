# &lt;open-heart&gt;

A button for the [`Open Heart Protocol`](https://github.com/mochokidae/OpenHeart).

üöß Highly experimental. Tag a version to avoid unexpected changes.

## Usage

```html
<!-- Include `OpenHeartElement` -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/open-heart-element" type="module"></script>

<!-- Render `<open-heart>` -->
<open-heart 
  href="https://api.oh.dddddddddzzzz.org/github.com/dddddddddzzzz/open-heart-element" 
  emoji="‚ù§Ô∏è">
  ‚ô•
</open-heart>
```

This sends a POST to the `href` with `‚ù§Ô∏è` in the body, and sets a key in `localStorage` to remember that a heart has been sent for this `href`.
