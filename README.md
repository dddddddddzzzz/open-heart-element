# &lt;open-heart&gt;

A button to POST an emoji to an endpoint.

See it in action at [at the bottom of this page](https://muan.co/posts/presence#like-prompt) shown as plain text prompt "Like this post?".

üöß Highly experimental. Tag a version to avoid unexpected changes.

It's fairly straightforward to set up an endpoint, here are some examples:

- [Using Cloudflare Workers & Cloudflare KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/) with [less than 30 lines of code](https://gist.github.com/muan/388430d0ed03c55662e72bb98ff28f03).
- [A Node server w/ a flat file database (hosted on Glitch).](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/open-heart-server-demo)

## Usage

```html
<!-- Include `OpenHeartElement` -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/open-heart-element" type="module" defer></script>

<!-- Render `<open-heart>` -->
<open-heart href="https://httpbin.org/post?id=x" emoji="‚ù§Ô∏è">‚ô•</open-heart>
```

This sends a POST to the `href` with `emoji=‚ù§Ô∏è` and sets a key in `localStorage` to remember that a heart has been sent for this `href`.

### Styling

This element does not come with any styling. Feel free to take whatever that's on the demo page.
